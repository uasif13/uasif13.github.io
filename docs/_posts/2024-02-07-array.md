Phew! I wrote a lot last post. If you want to read it, you can check it out here: [CPP development](https://uasif13.github.io/cpp/2024/02/06/cpp.html). I've made some headway into my cpp journey. I'm getting familiar with the debugger. There are three parts in vscode- the variables, watch, and the call stack. The call stack is good to know where and how you got to the part of the program that you are working on. It contains the methods called in reverse chronological order. The variables are useful to see the value stored with them. This includes pointers and values. For pointers, you can see the value at the location but that doesn't count for arrays which contain multiple values in a contiguous format. To see all the values, add the array to the watch section:

```
<!-- VSCode -->
*array@len 
<!-- GDB -->
p *array@len
```

After setting up the debugger, I worked towards completing the sort function for arrays. Here it is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "sorting.h"

// const int get_length(const int *& arr);
int * sort(int * arr,int * sorted, const int length);
void print_arr(int* arr, const int length);

int main() {
    // Cannot use initializer list for pointers. 
    // Use new operator or other variable.
    const int length = 5;
    int a [length];
    int b [length] = {1,3,2,5,4};
    int *g;
    // Rest are zeros.
    int c [length] = {3,1,2};
    int d [length] = {};
    int e [] = {6,8,3,2,5};
    int f [] {6,5,3,4};
    int * sorted;
    // const int length = get_length(arr);
    g = sort(e, sorted, length);
    print_arr(g,length);
    return 0;
}

int* sort(int * arr,int * sorted, const int length) {
//     // Size of arr can be found with .size() - https://cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/size/
    // int * sorted = new int[arr.size()];
    // In gdb, use p * array@len to get the values of the array
    int j = 0;
    int min = INT16_MAX;
    int min_index = 0;
    while (j < length) {
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (arr[i] < min) {
                min = arr[i];
                min_index = i;
            }
        }
        sorted[j] = min;
        min = INT16_MAX;
        arr[min_index]=INT16_MAX;
        j += 1;
    }
    return sorted;
}

void print_arr(int* arr, const int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        std::cout << *(arr+i) << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;    
}

```

One important thing to note is that the array identifiers are synonymous to pointers. This means that

```cpp
int identifier[];
```
is equivalent to
```cpp
int * identifier;
```

There's a lot less cout statements which is great. The sorting functionality finds the next min element in an arr and inserts it in the beginning. This has a time complexity of n^2. The neat part of this code is two things. The first is that I have included the function prototypes to the methods. I wanted to test whether the main function would compile without them- which it doesn't. It's nice to see the main function at the top since that is the entrypoint into the code. Another neat thing is all the different ways that I declared and initialized arrays. My favorite one is with the identifier f. No equal sign or length but the compiler can understand I want an array of size 4. 

Key Points:
- p * array@len is the way to display arrays in cpp debuggers.
- arrays and pointer variables are equivalent.
